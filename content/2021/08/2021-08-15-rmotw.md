Welcome back to to MOTW! This week we'll be finishing up from [part 2]({filename}/2021-08-08-rmotw.md), exploring the last of `std::fs`. So far Rudgal has been able to iterate, sort and organize his vast fauna photo collection but now it's time to accomplish his final goal (for the season):

**Cataloguing**.

# The module

[std::fs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fs/index.html) is the standard Rust module for interacting with a Filesystem. It handles a lot of the messy work when it comes to all the different ways that the underlying OS likes to handle files. Creating, Reading, Updating, Deleting, it's all there! Not every operation is supported by every OS, but this guide will try to remain as platform agnostic as possible.

# The story so far

[Rudgal The Delirious](https://www.fantasynamegenerators.com/dnd-orc-names.php) is the local Ornithologist. Armed with his trusty camera he's been tasked by the local Government to catalog and identify all of the birds in his local area. As he has to identify not only the species but the individual birds he's ended up with quite a few photos!

Last week Rudgal immersed himself in the strange and terrible mysteries that are *time magics*, *symbolic links* and *file copying*. Very spooky. Now that all of his photos were arranged by date, it was time to catalog all of the subjects that he had managed to capture with his **SnapMagic 9000**. The greatest feature of this camera is that it has the ability to identify any particular subject when it takes photos! So if you take a picture of a Ruby-throated rainbow-stained Wood Duck `A`, you can rest assured that any photo with `A` in the file name contains that same Duck.

> At least I don't have to hang little signs around their neck anymore.

If you remember from last week, the files that are produced by this device are named something like `IMG_zbj_6724.jpg`. Each file is composed of three pieces:

1. A prefix (`IMG_`)
2. The identification letters of the subjects in the photo
3. The photo number (always increasing)

Armed with his `std::fs` tools, Rudgal prepared himself to write a report about the local fauna for the King.

## Counting the birds

First step, Rudgal decides, is to
